Encheste a minha vida d'amargura.
Encheste a minha vida de martyrios.
Enchi a tua vida de ternura,
E vou encher o teu coval de lyrios.




+Dia 13+


A sombra vae cahindo lentamente.
Cahindo, amortalhando devagar
A hostia ensanguentada do poente!
Ouvem-se ao longe as fontes soluar...

A aragem murmura docemente.
Ha preces de novena pelo ar.
A natureza s vezes tambem sente!
Ha tardes em que o ceu sabe chorar!

As velas assustadas, pela serra,
Parram de mor, fitando a Terra!
Passa um enterro...  nova, vae to cdo!

Falam maguas nos olhos de quem passa...
Anda no ar um vento de Desgraa!
Amor, as tuas mos... eu tenho mdo!


13--Maro 1916




+A vida  uma walsa...+


Naquela walsa que dansamos, lenta e linda,
Num baile onde, ao acaso, um dia te encontrei,
Sem qu'rer, fiz-te chorar. Eu lembro-me ainda!
Foi toda a minha vida... a walsa que dansei!

Senti a tua alma entrar dentro da minha;
E ouvi teu corao falar muito baixinho.
E ainda pressenti que a tua alma tinha
Anceios de contar soluos de carinho.

Sentindo as tuas mos nas minhas a queimar,
Eu disse-te oraes... e ouvi-te murmurar
Palavras que de cr meu peito diz ainda!

Vejo-te assim; juntinha a mim, d'olhos fechados...
Eu sinto que ns dois andamos abraados,
Dansando devagar, aquela walsa linda!


1916




+Fria+


Qu'importa o teu olhar sja to lindo,
E tenha a cr da luz que tem o dia?
Qu'importa o teu sorriso doce, infindo,
Se s fria, como a pedra, fria, fria!

Qu'importa esse teu corpo, se no sente!?
A alvura do teu colo sempre a arfar,
Se no tem o calor que d  gente,
A fora p'ra viver e para amar?!

Amor, no teu olhar eu tenho lido aos poucos,
Anceios exquisitos, sonhos loucos...
E s fria como a louza em cemiterio!

Envolta nesse manto de Beleza,
Quando olho dos teus olhos a frieza,
Eu quedo-me a scismar nesse misterio!


1916




+Teus olhos falam maguas...+


Os teus olhos maguados dizem tanto!
Aos meus olhos, sem qu'rer, teem contado
As maguas, os sorrisos, mais o pranto,
Que teus olhos maguados tem chorado.

Teus olhos maguados vo no bero
Do meu peito, e dormem de mansinho.
Teus olhos,--Padre-Nossos--so d'um tero,
Contas d'Amor, que eu rezo to baixinho...

Teus olhos maguados so dois beijos.
So promessas, sonhos, so desejos...
E eu trago os olhos teus no corao.

So a luz da minh'alma entristecida;
Teus olhos maguados so a Vida,
E o sol da minha vida tambem so!


1916




+Violetas rxas+


Inda tenho as florinhas inquietas,
Que beijaram teus seios pequeninos,
Atravez d'essas rendas indiscretas,
Sob entremeios brancos e to finos!

Flor's que dos teus labios coralinos
Ouviram confidencias to secretas,
E que teus dedos brancos, peregrinos,
Deitaram fra... Pobres Violetas!

Perdidas pela sala e desatadas,
Encontrei-as, as pobres, requeimadas,
Ainda cheias desse teu encanto!

Mas l 'sto inquietas e viosas,
As que olharam teus seios vergonhosas...
Reviveram nas aguas do meu pranto.


1916




+A minha alma j morreu...+


Eu no te disse, Amr? Minh'alma j morreu
Canada de esperar teus olhos num anceio!
Canada de rezar baixinho o nome teu.
A noite era to linda! E o teu olhar no veio!

E o teu olhar no trouxe a sombra dum carinho
 minha pobre alma exausta de sofrer!
Luar! Tanto Luar havia no caminho...
E a luz do teu olhar no quiz v-la morrer!

O teu olhar matou-a! E no quizeste vir
Trazer-lhe uma grinalda branca do teu rir.
Ao menos murmurar baixinho uma orao!

Amor, sempre julguei que as tuas mos pequenas,
Branquinhas como duas aucenas,
Viessem ageitar minh'alma no caixo!


1917




+Vendida+


Vendeste a tua boca, aquela que beijra
Purinha e a sorrir, meus versos a chorar.
Vendeste as tuas mos, febris que eu apertra,
E outr'ora j por mim se ergueram a rezar.

Vendeste o teu olhar, e o corpo airoso e lindo,
Enlevo do meu sonho, a luz do meu viver.
Vendeste o teu sorrir, sorriso doce, infindo...
Que fra para mim alivio de sofrer!

E nem sequer tens pena! s d'el' que te comprou!
Vender's a tua boca, aquela que beijou
Meus versos a chorar por ti n'uma paixo!

s minha? s d'ele? s minha  luz do sentimento!
Tu vives d'este amor.  meu teu pensamento.
s minha! No vendeste ainda o corao.


1917




+Um peccado+


Silhuete do Amor, corpinho d'anfora, esguia!
Olhar sonhando a rir, promessas e desejos.
Braza a queimar, a arder, acesa  luz do dia...
Boca to linda... e boca virgem dos meus beijos!

s a esfinge da Graa! O sonho do Noivado!
Uma orao trazida  Terra, pela Virgem!
E s tambem ainda um mixto do Pecado...
A figura do Amor na tela da Vertigem!

Tu sabes quem eu sou; e cr, quando te vejo,
Eu tenho a impresso do que seria um beijo,
Em frente do Senhor,  luz do corao!

Mas tu, sorris, e ris... e eu qudo-me a scismar,
Como seria bela a vida a recordar,
Um longo beijo teu--Peccado, e Orao!

+Envlta no "manton" das rosas vermelhas...+


Hasde ser minha, eu quero,  quanto basta!
Um dia, quando fr, no o procuro.
E  o desejo ardente que me arrasta,
Aquel' que hade fazer vibrar-te, eu juro!

Um dia, quando fr... heide deixar
Nos seios que tu tens, beijos aos molhos!
Nodoas de lyrios roxos a sangrar...
E olheiras cr da noite nos teus olhos!

No tenhas iluses! Nunca a tua Raa
Me vencer a mim por mais que faa!
Quero-te. Eu sinto a ancia de beijar!

Queimada pelo fogo dos meus beijos
Heide sentir-te louca de desejos...
Um dia, quando fr... sem eu te amar!

+Na Praia-Mar do Sonho+


Decerto tu j viste ao sol-poente,
O mar beijar a areia de mansinho.
Parado, a olha-la docemente,
Num grande sonho, louco, de carinho.

Depois  densa a treva. O mar  louco.
E briga com a areia, encapelado.
Embravecido cana, e pouco a pouco,
Solua a grande dr dum revoltado!

Assim, houve luar e noite escura,
N'aquela doce noite de amargura,
Misterio indefinido que profundo!

Assim,  a tu'alma p'ra minh'alma,
-- minha mar-viva e mar-calma,
Do grande mar, da Dr em que me afundo!


1920




+A mascara loira+


 minha viciosa, esterica e perversa,
De linhas sensuaes; teu corpo thrisado,
Tem frases de requinte, em lubrica conversa!
Tem lume de cigarro, loiro e opiado!

Teus olhos a boiar, so taas d'absynto.
E a tua silhuete loira e desgrenhada,
Tem risos de cristaes partidos, que eu bem sinto,
Em noites de volupia,  luz da madrugada!

 noite, as tuas mos, so gumes de punhal,
Depois de terem morto--alguem sem fazer mal...
Tua voz  o Fado... eu ouo-o quando passa!

No Mundo s o Drama, a Fara, s a Comedia!
s vezes tambem s--palhao--na Tragedia!
s a figura loira e linda da Desgraa!


1921




+Abandono+


Decerto tu sentiste o abandono,
Que vae acompanhando o sol-poente,
Nas tardes tristes, lividas, do outono,
E quando chora o corao da gente!

Tardes pedindo ao sol a Extrema-Unco,
Numa ancia doentia de mais luz!
Decerto tu sentiste a sensao,
De ajoelhar's em frente d'uma cruz!

Tu entraste  tarde na Egreja,
 hora de resar's--bemdita seja,
A cr to doentia do Outono!--

Tudo sentiste... e os olhos rasos d'agua!
Que pena no sentir's a minha magua!
A vaga incompreenso d'este abandono!


1921




+13 lyrios+

Atei-os com os fios d'oiro daquela taa de
crystal bohme que partiste...


Encheste a minha vida d'amargura.
Encheste a minha vida de martyrios.
Enchi a tua vida de ternura,
E vou encher o teu coval de lyrios.

So 13 os lyrios roxos que levei.
--Meus versos de saudade so p'ra ti.
Amor, num dia 13 te encontrei!
Num dia 13, Amor, eu te perdi.

Meu doce Amor perdido... heide te vr,
Na luz que tem o co manhecer,
Na cr do sol-poente em que reparo!

E o nome que tiveste,  loira e linda,
Que certa rosa branca fala ainda...
Ser p'la vida fra o meu amparo!

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
